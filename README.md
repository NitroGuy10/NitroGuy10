# 👋 Hey, friends! 💖

I'm NitroGuy, a software engineer and music producer :)

I am highly interested in computer science and software development. I would call myself a "full-stack web developer" as of now but I am very eager to explore other facets of computer science. I am proficient in Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C++, and C#.
